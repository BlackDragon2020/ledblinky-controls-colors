# ledblinky-controls-colors

This repository contains both the colors.ini and controls.ini file used by [LEDBlinky](https://www.ledblinky.net).

## controls.ini
controls.ini originated from the "Controls.dat" project, created by Kevin Jonas (SirPoonga) and Howard Castro. This project was hosted at controls.arcadecontrols.com ([archive.org snapshot](http://web.archive.org/web/20150908135203/http://controls.arcadecontrols.com/)) but appears to be dead. Forum discussions around this original project [can be found here](http://forum.arcadecontrols.com/index.php?board=45.0). Originally created to document the controls of MAME games, this file has been used as the basis in other emulators.

From the archive.org snapshot:

> Controls.dat is a project started by Kevin Jonas (SirPoonga) with the help of Howard Casto. This project was started to accurately document the controls and button labels of the arcade control panels from the games in M.A.M.E.. The goal of this project to accurately document M.A.M.E. outputs by using the labels the games used on their control panels. The benefit of this is frontend developers can use these resources to display the controls for the games.

> Many volunteers have entered in the data for this project. I'd like to thank all the volunteers for the hard work they have done.

## colors.ini

colors.ini was originally [created by headkaze](http://forum.arcadecontrols.com/index.php?topic=61354.0) and is now hosted by [LEDBlinky]((https://www.ledblinky.net)), a great piece of software that controls your arcade LEDs. It has been used as the basis for other similar color configuration files/utilities.

## Purpose

As controls.ini appears to be dead and colors.ini is not versioned and out-of-date, I created this repository to:

- Maintain a current/up-to-date version of these files
- Allow for the community to contribute updates, fixes, etc
